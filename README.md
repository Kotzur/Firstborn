#Firstborn
This is essentially the first real java project I made. It's a desktop organizer for students doing the IB diploma with a very simple GUI.

Everything is in JavaFX. It was written in IntelliJ IDE with the help from SceneBuilder.

I just want to dump something out there onto Github to call it my own.
It certainly is not perfect, but I may return to it in the future.

My to-do list:
	Add edit and delete functions
	Add a temporary delete actions tab, where deleted actions can be recovered
	Figure out a decent encryption system
	Figure out how to save logins and passwords
