This is the first java project I made. It's a desktop organizer for students doing the IB diploma with a very simple GUI.

Everything is in JavaFX. It was written in IntelliJ IDE with the help from SceneBuilder.

Todo:
- Add edit and delete functions
- Add a temporary delete actions tab, where deleted actions can be recovered
- Figure out a decent encryption system
- Figure out how to save logins and passwords
- Add a graphical calendar
- Create a graphical schedule
